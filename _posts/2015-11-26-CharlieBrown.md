# Movie review of Charlie Brown Thanksgiving

Peppermint Patty invites herself and two friends to Charlie Brown's house for Thanksgiving dinner and he won't even be home!

I believe that this movie is very good! It involves the Peanut gang and Snoopy and Woodstock.

You should watch this sometime, you're sure to like it!
