ZOOTOPIA IS AWSOME!!

Oh my gosh this movie is so great. 

It's about predator and prey and how they can work together.

At the start of the movie, a little rabbit named Judy put's on a play. When a tiger pretends to hurt her, she flings herself on the floor with a red ribbon, throwing it in the air shouting "blood!blood!blood!" Then she takes a ketchup  bottle, puts it on her belly, and squeezes it, still shouting blood.
